# Life Inside a House
### Apple WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge winning project

With the ongoing global health situation, we have been spending a lot of our time in our homes and our rooms.

This project (Life Inside a House) tries to simulate that reality in a game environment. The house environment features various objects the user can interact with including piano, yoga mat, laptop, and bed. The project also reflects the effects of our lifestyle through traits such as tranquility, fitness, and productivity associated with the user.

There's no definite way to play the game, it is up to the user. Through this project the users can have fun, introspect, experiment, and even learn a few new things (like the piano :D).
