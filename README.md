# Life Inside a House
### Apple WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge winning project

With the ongoing global health situation, we have been spending a lot of our time in our homes and our rooms.

This project (Life Inside a House) tries to simulate that reality in a game environment.

There's no definite way to play the game, it is up to you. Through this project you can have fun, introspect, experiment, and even learn a few new things (like the piano :D).
